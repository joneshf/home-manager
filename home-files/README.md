# home-files

## Motivation

We sometimes need to write configuration explicitly that should wind up _somewhere_ in the home directory.
These files are a little easier to manage if the editor can show us helpful stuff like syntax highlighting or formatting errors.
This directory is where we're dumping all of those files.

## Structure

To make it a little easier to manage,
we're trying to have the directory structure mirror the structure that should be created in the home directory.
